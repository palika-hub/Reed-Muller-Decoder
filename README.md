# Reed-Muller-Decoder
This repository contains a Python script for decoding Reed-Muller codes. The script implements functions for generating multilinear terms, calculating multilinear functions, and decoding buggy codewords.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
4.  Run the main script `reed_muller_decoder.py` to use the decoder.
5. Enter the values of `n`, `k`, and the buggy codeword as prompted.
6. Click the "Submit" button to decode the Reed-Muller code.
7. The multilinear function, message, and detailed evaluations will be displayed.

## File Structure
- `reed_muller_decoder.py`: Main Python script containing the decoding functions.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.
- Other files as required for the functionality.

  ## Future Improvements
- Add error correction capabilities for more robust decoding.
- Enhance the GUI for better user experience.
